### Hi there 👋

I'm Dat. I work in the intersection between humans and machines. 

- 👨‍💻 I've been doing open-source for ages. Here are some of my projects that I contributed to:
  * [imagededup](https://github.com/idealo/imagededup) - 😎 Finding duplicate images made easy!
  * [image-super-resolution](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) - 🔎 Super-scale your images and run experiments with Residual Dense and Adversarial Networks.
  * [jupyter2slides](https://github.com/datitran/jupyter2slides) - Cloud Native Presentation Slides with Jupyter Notebook + Reveal.js
- 📫 Feel free to reach me at <hello@dat-tran.com> for work-related inquiries
